# Technical Context

This document details the technologies, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies for the Deep Learning Micro Nasdaq TimesTrader project.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch (for TimesNet and PPO implementation)
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Time Series Analysis:** Potentially libraries like `statsmodels` or `tsfresh` for additional feature engineering.
- **Trading Environment:** Custom-built simulation environment using OpenAI Gym interface principles.
- **Data Storage:** Flat files (CSV, Parquet) initially, potentially a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for real-time data.
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Task Management:** Task Master AI

## Development Setup

- **Environment Management:** Virtual environments (venv, conda)
- **Dependency Management:** pip with `requirements.txt`
- **Code Editor:** VS Code (with relevant Python and other extensions)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Testing Framework:** Pytest

## Technical Constraints

- **Data Latency:** Real-time trading requires low-latency data processing and signal generation.
- **Computational Resources:** Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive, requiring access to GPUs.
- **Market Microstructure:** The high-frequency nature of the Micro Nasdaq market necessitates careful consideration of transaction costs and slippage.
- **API Limitations:** Potential limitations of trading platform APIs for real-time data and order execution.

## Dependencies

- See `requirements.txt` for a comprehensive list of Python dependencies.
- External data sources for historical and real-time market data.
- Potential dependency on a trading platform API (e.g., NinjaTrader).

## Tool Usage Patterns

- **Docker:** Used for creating consistent and reproducible development and deployment environments.
- **Task Master AI:** Used for managing project tasks and workflow.
- **Git:** Used for version control and collaboration.
- **Pytest:** Used for unit and integration testing.

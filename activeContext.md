# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus of work, recent changes, next steps, and active considerations for the Deep Learning Micro Nasdaq TimesTrader project.

## Current Focus

Resolving existing unit test issues, particularly for the PPO trading agent, to ensure the stability of individual components before proceeding with integration testing.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the memory bank documentation.
- Organized the TimesTrader folder by deleting unused files.
- Attempted to implement Gemini caching (but encountered issues with the google-generativeai library and API key setup).
- Attempted to fix PPO agent unit tests (but encountered persistent issues with test setup and file modification).
- Re-evaluated project plan based on VPM deployment target.
- Decided to prioritize resolving existing unit test failures/issues before focusing on integration or infrastructure tasks.

## Next Steps

- Investigate and fix the persistent issues with PPO agent unit tests.
- Verify that unit tests for other key components (TimesNetExtractor, XGBoost Validator, etc.) are passing.
- Update relevant tasks in `tasks.json` or `progress.md` as issues are resolved.
- Transition to a phase focused on integration testing once unit tests are stable.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The target deployment environment is a Virtual Private Machine (VPM), not a distributed or cloud-based system requiring complex orchestration (like Kubernetes).
- This significantly impacts the scope and complexity needed for tasks like CI/CD (Task 12), which should be re-scoped to focus on automated testing, simplified artifact building, and VPM-compatible deployment.
- The Monitoring (Task 10) and Containerization (Task 11) tasks may also need adjustments to align with a VPM environment.
- How to resolve the issues preventing the PPO agent tests from passing is the immediate priority.
- Ensuring all core components have stable and passing unit tests is a prerequisite for effective integration testing.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adhering to the defined memory bank structure.
- Prioritizing clear and concise documentation.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has an existing codebase with various components for data handling, modeling, trading, and testing.
- There are existing documentation files in the `docs` directory that should be reviewed and potentially integrated or referenced in the memory bank.
- There are challenges in setting up the testing environment and ensuring compatibility between different components, especially when dealing with external libraries and APIs.

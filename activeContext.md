## Validator Dashboard Enhancements - Session Summary (2025-05-22)

**Objective:** Complete and refine the XGBoost Validator Metrics Dashboard.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Timeseries Chart Major Rework:**

    - Changed from faceted columns to a single chart area with categories grouped side-by-side.
    - Implemented stacking for `PPO` vs. `Validated` signal sources within each category bar.
    - Updated color scheme as per user request:
      - Categories: Buy (green), Sell (red), Do Nothing (gray).
      - Sources: PPO (yellow), Validated (blue).
    - Corrected issues with bar widths, spacing, and hovertext to accurately reflect the new structure.

2.  **Port Conflict Resolution:**

    - Changed the dashboard's default port to `8061` to avoid conflicts with other services.

3.  **Internationalization:**

    - Completed the translation of all remaining UI elements from Portuguese to English.

4.  **Data Handling & Mock Data:**

    - Increased the mock data generation from 150 to 500 events to provide a richer dataset for visualization.
    - Improved the distribution of confidence values in mock data for more realistic testing of the confidence histogram.
    - Implemented more robust handling for empty or incomplete data scenarios to prevent chart rendering errors.
    - Resolved various `TypeError` and variable declaration issues in the data processing and callback logic.

5.  **Visualization Enhancements (Beyond Timeseries):**

    - **Status Counts:** Confirmed horizontal bar chart implementation with percentage labels for clarity.
    - **Confidence Distribution:** Ensured histogram correctly displays low/medium/high confidence bands and uses a vertical orientation for the distribution with a horizontal bar representation.
    - **Donut Charts:** Verified the implementation of donut charts for key metrics: Acceptance Rate, Average Confidence, and PPO-XGBoost Agreement, all with percentage indicators.
    - **Time Interval:** Confirmed 5-minute groupings for the time series chart.

6.  **UI/UX Refinements:**

    - Ensured percentage indicators are present across all relevant visualizations.
    - Improved tooltips to consistently show counts and percentages on hover.
    - Increased the default page size for the recent events table from 10 to 20 rows.
    - Maintained consistent color-coding for confidence levels (red/orange/green) in the confidence distribution chart.

7.  **Task Management:**
    - Updated Taskmaster task 8 ("Develop XGBoost Validator") to reflect the completion of the dashboard enhancements.
    - Successfully (after some troubleshooting with subtask IDs) marked the relevant subtasks (8.5 and a new summary subtask 9.9) as "done".

**Final Status:** The validator dashboard is now functionally complete, with all requested features and enhancements implemented. The application runs correctly on port 8061, displays data as intended, and provides a comprehensive overview of validator performance.

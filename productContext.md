# Product Context

This document describes the "why" behind the Deep Learning Micro Nasdaq TimesTrader project, focusing on the problems it aims to solve and the desired user experience.

## Problem Statement

Traditional trading approaches often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and complex nature of the Micro Nasdaq futures market. Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to human bias, while rule-based automated systems may lack the flexibility to capture subtle market patterns. There is a need for a more sophisticated, data-driven approach that can identify profitable trading opportunities and manage risk effectively in a high-frequency environment.

## Solution

The project aims to address this problem by developing a deep learning-powered trading system. By leveraging TimesNet for advanced time series feature extraction and PPO for optimal trading decision-making, the system will be able to:

- Identify complex patterns in historical and real-time market data.
- Make autonomous trading decisions based on learned strategies.
- Adapt to changing market conditions through continuous learning (future).
- Provide tools for performance monitoring and analysis.

## User Experience Goals

- **Reliability:** The system should be stable and reliable for automated trading.
- **Transparency:** Users should have visibility into the system's performance and decision-making process (through monitoring and analysis tools).
- **Flexibility:** The modular design should allow for easy integration of new models, strategies, or data sources.
- **Ease of Use:** While a sophisticated system, the interface and documentation should be clear enough for users to understand and operate it effectively.
- **Performance:** The system should be able to process data and execute trades with low latency.

# System Patterns

This document outlines the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, and component relationships within the Deep Learning Micro Nasdaq TimesTrader project.

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular architecture, with distinct components for data handling, model development, trading execution, and monitoring. This allows for flexibility and independent development/testing of each part.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizing TimesNet for feature extraction from time series data and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for reinforcement learning-based trading decisions.
- **Data Pipelines:** Implementing separate pipelines for historical and real-time data to ensure efficient processing and timely signal generation.
- **Position Management:** Employing a dedicated position manager to handle trade execution, risk control, and portfolio management.
- **Modularity:** Designing components to be interchangeable and independently testable.

## Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern:** Potentially used for real-time data updates and alerting in the monitoring system.
- **Factory Pattern:** Could be used for creating different types of trading agents or model configurations.
- **Dependency Injection:** To manage dependencies between different modules and facilitate testing.

## Component Relationships

- **Data Manager:** Provides processed data to the TimesNet Extractor and Trading Environment.
- **TimesNet Extractor:** Outputs features used by the PPO Agent.
- **PPO Agent:** Receives features and the trading environment state to make trading decisions.
- **Position Manager:** Executes trades based on signals from the PPO Agent and enforces risk rules.
- **Monitoring System:** Receives data from the Trading Environment and Position Manager to track performance and system health.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- The data flow from raw data to trade execution is a critical path that requires low latency and high reliability.
- The interaction between the PPO Agent and the Trading Environment during training and execution is crucial for effective learning and performance.

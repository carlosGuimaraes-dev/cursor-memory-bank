# Progress

This document tracks the current status of the Deep Learning Micro Nasdaq TimesTrader project, including what has been built, what remains, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- Initial project structure and directories are set up.
- Core memory bank documentation files have been created.
- Basic data handling components are likely present (based on file structure).
- Some model components (TimesNet, PPO) and trading environment elements appear to exist.
- Testing framework (Pytest) is in place.
- Docker configuration is available.
- Unused files in the root directory have been deleted.

## What's Left to Build

- Detailed implementation of data pipelines for various timeframes.
- Complete TimesNet feature extraction and integration with the trading environment.
- Full implementation and training of the PPO agent.
- Robust backtesting and evaluation framework.
- Real-time data integration and trading execution logic.
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system.
- Integration with a trading platform (e.g., NinjaTrader).
- Thorough testing and validation of all components.
- Refinement of trading strategy and risk management rules.
- Implementation of CI/CD pipeline for model updates.
- Thorough integration and system testing of all components.
- Implementation of a simplified VPM-compatible deployment workflow (revised Task 12).
- Implementation of a VPM-appropriate monitoring and alerting system (revised Task 10).
- Preparation of the application for VPM deployment (revised Task 11).

## Current Status

The project has completed the initial implementation of core components. The current focus is on **stabilizing and resolving issues with existing unit tests**, particularly for the PPO trading agent, to ensure the reliability of individual modules before proceeding with integration. The deployment target has been clarified as a VPM, which will necessitate revisions to infrastructure-related tasks (CI/CD, Monitoring, Containerization).

## Known Issues

- Persistent issues with setting up the testing environment and running unit tests for the PPO agent, including potential dependency conflicts and code compatibility problems.
- Inability to implement Gemini caching due to google-generativeai library issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- This section will track significant changes in technical decisions, architecture, or strategy as the project evolves.

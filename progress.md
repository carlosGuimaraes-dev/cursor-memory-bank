### Session Date: 2025-05-22

**Summary:**
Completed a major overhaul and finalization of the XGBoost Validator Metrics Dashboard. Key achievements include a complete redesign of the time series chart to group categories side-by-side with stacked sources (PPO/Validated) and an updated color scheme. Resolved port conflicts by moving the dashboard to port 8061. Finished translating the UI to English. Enhanced data handling by increasing mock data volume to 500 events, improving confidence value distribution in mock data, and implementing robust error handling for empty/incomplete datasets. Corrected various TypeErrors and variable declaration issues. Verified and refined other visualizations: status counts (horizontal bar chart with percentages), confidence distribution (histogram with confidence bands), and new donut charts for acceptance rate, average confidence, and PPO-XGBoost agreement. UI/UX was improved with consistent percentage indicators, better tooltips, an increased table page size, and adherence to color schemes. Successfully updated Taskmaster task 8 and its relevant subtasks (8.5, 9.9) to reflect the completion of the dashboard.
